## Motivation
Consumer loans are a relatively new asset class available for private citizens to invest in. They potentially offer returns similar to traditional investments while offering lower portfolio volatility. However, a significant number of consumer loans are defaulted on by the borrowers. A significant amount of capital can be lost to defaults if a portfolio invests in loans based off of poor criteria. The goal of this project is to construct a model to predict the ROI of a loan in order to determine if it would be a good investment. Once a model is built it can be run through a portfolio simulation of historical loan payment data to analyze how the model's strategy would have performed.
